    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In a global scenario still affected by severe income distribution imbalances and chronic famine in several communities, the accurate classification of cropland pieces is of utmost strategic and economic importance. As described in [1], crop maps play \"<em>an important role in various applications such as crop inventories, crop insurance, yield estimation and the enforcement of quota limits</em>\".</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) have been reliable tools in remote crop mapping. Remote sensors like radiometers and radars positioned in unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites enable a continuous, high quality, relatively reduced cost monitoring of the Earth surface use by agriculture, addressing specific issues inherent to the problem, like for example the dynamic changes of crop characteristics and growing stages over time. As the evaluation of such technologies is not a purpose of this work, readers are encouraged to consult the brilliant references cited for a high quality education on the subject.</p>"

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Among remote sensing solutions, <b>optical</b> and <b>radar-based</b> sensing techniques demand special consideration when it comes to cropland classification. Furthermore, a combination of both has consistently led to high accuracy identification of crops of varied nature and in different development stages.</p>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The dataset serving as the basis for this machine learning study, described in detail in Section 3, contains a large set of numerical features derived from remote sensing information assembled by two primary sources:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Optical information (actual images) was collected by RapidEye satellites;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Radar-based information was collected by an Unihnabitated Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) system.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">As the amount and complexity of data gathered from such different sources over several time spans is inherently huge, <b>machine learning</b> plays a central role when it comes to the final classification purpose. The literature is vast and describes inumerous approaches and techniques to manipulate such information. The researchers cited in foreword have themselves assessed several solutions, stacked random forests in particular, with overall accuracies ranging from 90 to 96% for different stacking strategies. It has been noted though that some of the references are outdated, which suggests that the use of state-of-the-art classification engines - random forest and neural network classifiers - may lead to further metric improvements.</p>"

    "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This 'dual' machine learning exercise was of particular interest from a data science educational perspective. Comments:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">First and foremost, results confirm that the combination of optical and radar-based information leads to very accurate remote cropland mapping;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Once again the importance of proper data preprocessing was revealed. This particular dataset - which proved at the end to be very robust and representative - was originally affected by <b>severe feature intercorrelation</b>. Indeed, one of the articles co-authored by Dr. Khosravi was entirely dedicated to a method to reduce the dataset dimensionality. Dropping redundant estimators is a healthy measure to mitigate colinearity and optimize machine architectures - and so was done;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Nice results were obtained with one of the most classic random forest classifiers available. It is though important to mention that the selection of a proper number of trees and depth parameters may affect results significantly. The author experimented with both smaller numbers of trees and lower depth architectures, and some deterioration was observed, as expected. If properly manipulated, random forests are great predictive tools and their performance pretty much matches those of more complex, sophisticated algorithms;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">The neural network performed slightly better than the random forest. As discussed above, also here the adequate architecture and hyperparameter selection is key;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">Some potential improvements were left aside (treatment of skewed features, cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization) to be revisited after the final performance was known. As both machines performed outstandingly, such potential improvements were not pursued. Readers are though invited to experiment;</li>\n",
    "    <li style=\"text-align: justify\">At last, the inspection of both confusion matrices indicates that:</li>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li style=\"text-align: justify\">More 'confusion' is experienced between '<b>wheat</b>' and '<b>oat</b>' crop cultures, which account for the highest numbers of incorrect predictions;</li>\n",
    "        <li style=\"text-align: justify\">In general terms, accuracies per crop class did not differ much - all above 99%. The exception was the '<b>broadleaf</b>' class, where accuracies were relatively lower. This should be expected, as this is the most misrepresented class (smallest number of observations);</li>\n",
    "        <li>Focusing now on the '<b>broadleaf</b>' class, deep learning was evidently superior in predicting such crops, suggesting that it might be a better alternative to tackle misrepresented classes in general.</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
